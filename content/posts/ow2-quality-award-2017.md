The SeedStack project received the OW2 quality award during the 2017 edition of [OW2con](https://www.ow2con.org), the 
OW2 annual community event. <!--more-->

We received the award from the hands of Cedric Thomas, CEO of [OW2]((https://www.ow2.org)). We are very proud to be a 
recognized member of the OW2 and would like to thank the jury for this honor.
