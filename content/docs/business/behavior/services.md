{{< callout def >}}
**A service is a stateless object that implements domain, applicative or infrastructure logic.**
{{< /callout >}}
<!--more-->

## Characteristics

Services can come in three flavors, depending upon the layer where they reside.

### Domain services

A domain service contains pure domain logic that does not fit naturally on any existing domain object. Its name and the name 
of its operations should come from the {{< term "ubiquitous language" >}} or be introduced into it if necessary. 
Parameters and return values should be domain objects or language types.

### Application services

An application service contains coordination logic between other services. It is more tied to a specific use-case 
of the system from which it execute all the steps in a well-defined unit of work. Application services are often the 
ideal place to begin and end transactions.

### Infrastructure services

An infrastructure service focuses on encapsulating a technical aspect of the application, like filesystem access, 
email, notifications, ...   

### Statelessness

A service is always stateless. This does not mean that a service cannot change the global state of the application
(that is, it may have side effects), but it should never hold a state of its own that could affect its behavior.

## Declaration

To create a service with the business framework, create an interface annotated with {{< java "org.seedstack.business.Service" "@" >}}:

```java
@Service
public interface SomeService {
    void someOperation();
}
```

Then create its implementation:

```java
public class SomeServiceImpl implements SomeService {
    @Override
    public void someOperation() {
        // do something        
    }
}
```

{{< callout tips >}}
If you have more than one implementation of a service, you must differentiate them by applying a different 
[qualifier]({{< ref "docs/business/qualified-injection.md" >}}) on each implementation. 
{{< /callout >}}

## Usage

To use your service, [inject]({{< ref "learn/tutorial/dependency-injection.md" >}}) its interface: 

```java
public class SomeClass {
    @Inject
    private SomeService someService;
    
    public void someMethod() {
        someService.someServiceOperation();        
    }
}
```

## Example

Let's consider a fund transfer service. It does not fit naturally into the `Account` aggregate since it may have some complex
business logic that depends upon other services (currency exchange rate, transfer authorization between countries, ...).

```java
@Service
public interface FundsTransferService {
    MoneyTransferReport transferMoney(
            Account toBeDebited,
            Account toBeCredited,
            Amount transferAmount
    );
}
```

{{< callout tips >}}
Notice how the name of the service and its operation is meaningful from a business perspective. Avoid services with generic 
names such as "AccountManagementService" or worse "AccountService". Try instead to convey business meaning by using names
from the {{< term "ubiquitous language" >}}.
