This page will help you create and build your first SeedStack application.<!--more--> 

## Using the generator

Using the SeedStack generator is the easiest way to start building a new SeedStack application. It allows you to select
the type of project you want to create and, by answering a few questions, **generate a fully operational application**.

Assuming that you have [Maven installed](https://maven.apache.org/install.html), run the following command:

```bash
mvn -U org.seedstack:seedstack-maven-plugin:generate
```

Choose the `web` project type. Then just press enter each time the generator asks a question. It will use the default
values.

## Run the application

To run the Web application, use the `watch` goal. It will **watch source folders** and when something change trigger a 
recompile and an application refresh. Run the following command:

```bash
mvn seedstack:watch
```   
    
Then, in your favorite browser, go to `http://localhost:8080/hello`. It should display the "Hello World!" string.

You can terminate the application gracefully with `Ctrl+C`.

The `watch` goal supports the [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) protocol to automatically reload the browser page when
the application change. You must **install and activate a LiveReload extension for you browser** to make it work.

You can also run the application without hot-reloading with the `run` goal.

## Modify the application

Now that you have successfully run the application, let's modify it. The "Hello World!" text is generated by a REST 
resource located in the `HelloResource.java` file: 
 
* Change the text returned by the `hello()` method to something else.
* Save the file.
* The application should be refreshed.
* If you enabled the LiveReload extension (see above), the browser page should refresh automatically.

## That's it!

Congratulations! You've just successfully run and modified your first SeedStack application.

## Dependency management

SeedStack comes with full dependency-management so you **never have to specify individual component version**. 

This is done with a [Maven BOM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies)
imported in the POM of the project:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seedstack</groupId>
            <artifactId>seedstack-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{{< version g="org.seedstack" >}}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

## Packaging

You can package the application with the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

SeedStack automatically packages the application in a [one-JAR capsule](http://www.capsule.io/). After the build, this 
capsule is located into the `target` directory. 

It is a self-executable JAR you can run with the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/my-web-project-capsule.jar
```

## Java IDE 

If you want to use a Java IDE, just import the generated project as you would do with any Maven project.

To run the application directly from the IDE, create a "Run configuration" for a standalone Java application, and 
specify the `org.seedstack.seed.core.SeedMain` main class.

## Now what ?

On this page you have learned:

* How to create a SeedStack project from scratch using the generator.
* How to run the project in hot-reloading mode.
